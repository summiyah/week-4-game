# week-4-game

Started with basic layout of Crystal Collector game and then created styling. 

1. When user clicks on a crytal (no number is shown) then that number populates as total score. 

2. User wins game if total score reaches random number

3. If user goes above total score then user looses. 

4. Each time a player wins or looses the game restarts and counts wins/loses.
